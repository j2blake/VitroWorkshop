  # Where is the Vitro core directory?
  # In most deployments, this is set to ./vitro-core (It is not uncommon for this 
  # setting to point elsewhere in development environments).
  #   Examples:
  #      vitro.core.dir = ./vitro-core
  #      vitro.core.dir = ../Vitro
  #      vitro.core.dir = /usr/local/vitro/trunk
vitro.core.dir = ./Vitro

  #
  # The name of the VIVO application. This will be used as the name of the
  # subdirectory within your Tomcat server's /webapps directory. It also appears
  # in the URL for the application. For example, http://my.vivo.server/vivo
  #
webapp.name = vitro
